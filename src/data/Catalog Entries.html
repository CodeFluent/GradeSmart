Causal Inference and Evidence-based Policy.
Prerequisite: A graduate-level statistics course that covers probability theory, hypothesis testing and linear regression.  If unsure about prerequisite, contact the professor.
To answer cause-and-effect questions, a counterfactual model of causality and a unified methodological framework has been developed over the last three decades. This class aims to teach students to apply and interpret the counterfactual model and associated designs for answering policy-relevant empirical questions. Students will gain a deeper understanding of, and connections among, approaches to answering causal questions and of the nature of evidence itself. The topics comprise experimental designs and a suite of observational designs, including conditioning designs, partial identification designs, multiple control group designs, instrumental variable designs, regression discontinuity designs, synthetic control designs and tests of known effects and sensitivity tests to hidden bias. These topics are examined in a broad range of policy domains (poverty, planning, economic development, politics, crime, social work, health, public finance, environment, and others).

Prerequisite: Econ 2106
This course provides an introduction to the ways that economics can be used to understand cities.  The primary emphasis in the first half of the course is on the spatial organization of economic activity.  Why are cities located where they are, what economic functions do they perform, and, within cities, how can we understand what goes on where, and who lives where?  The tools that we develop as we deal with these questions will be essential in the second half of the course, in which we will take an economic approach to a number of policy issues that are loosely termed "urban problems" in the popular press.

Prerequisite: A graduate-level statistics course that covers probability theory, hypothesis testing and linear regression.  If unsure about prerequisite, contact the professor.
To answer cause-and-effect questions, a counterfactual model of causality and a unified methodological framework has been developed over the last three decades. This class aims to teach students to apply and interpret the counterfactual model and associated designs for answering policy-relevant empirical questions. Students will gain a deeper understanding of, and connections among, approaches to answering causal questions and of the nature of evidence itself. The topics comprise experimental designs and a suite of observational designs, including conditioning designs, partial identification designs, multiple control group designs, instrumental variable designs, regression discontinuity designs, synthetic control designs and tests of known effects and sensitivity tests to hidden bias. These topics are examined in a broad range of policy domains (poverty, planning, economic development, politics, crime, social work, health, public finance, environment, and others).

Prerequisites:  ENI 3101.
Requirements: CSP  1, 2, 6, 7.
The focus of this course is actually designing the product-service (offering) that can profitably capture customer demand. Once authentic customer demand is discovered and a compelling value proposition that satisfies that demand is verified, the next step is to design an offering that that customers will want to use and one that is sustainable. Students apply Lean/Agile design methodologies and customer value targets to iterate through offering designs, prototypes, and business models until a “best fit” design is achieved and "fast followers" can't easily imitate. This is a highly interactive course where students 1) engage in a variety of hands on team activities while in class and 2) design and test their own offering concepts.

Once a “best fit” product-service (offering) design is achieved that can profitably satisfy customer needs better than competitive solutions, a logical next step is to validate demand traction for that business model to ramp up customer sales. Students learn to apply various demand traction strategies and how to best position an offering in a competitive market to realize profitable revenue potential. It also addresses the capital funding process, progressive business plan development, types of investors, company valuation strategies, capitalization tables, negotiating tactics, term sheets, and more. Students create a mock start-up that takes them through this critical validation stage.

Requirements: CSP  1, 2, 6, 7.
This course focuses on scaling up a new venture. Once a startup has validated demand traction for its business model and obtained sufficient growth capital, it is set to make the transition to an early-stage growth company. The transition presents formidable challenges. The course examines many of the decisions that founders/owners must make and the resulting trade-offs that they must accept in this transition. Decisions regarding: gearing up for and financing rapid growth, changes in company governance, boards and advisors, intellectual property licensing, patents and trademarks, growth strategy, scaling business operations, strategic marketing, staffing, financial and risk management, exit strategies. This course challenges the student with these decisions and how to approach them.

This course follows the pattern of a typical internship course. However: you’ll be working for yourself (or team), you’ll be mentored by an “entrepreneur-in-residence” as evaluator, and you will be paying yourself in equity (there may be additional emoluments). Upon admission you’ll be assigned a slot in the incubator (space scheduling, locker, mentor, resources, etc.). In the incubator, each student/team’s needs are assessed and additional resources brought to bear. You’ll have access to resources provided through the incubator (legal, financial, marketing, investors, etc.) as needed, and available resources permit. The mission of the incubator (and this course) is to help you succeed. The onus is on you; faculty and mentors are facilitators, not guarantors.

Organizational Entrepreneurship. The course explores contemporary concepts, theories, methods, and tools for systematic and sustainable entrepreneurship within established organizations – companies, non-profits, and public sector organizations. Whether recognized or not, every organization has a continual stream of potential opportunities to create customer demand. However, the complexity and speed of business obscures these opportunities (and threats). Students learn a rigorous and disciplined methodology for discovering and prioritizing opportunities for demand creation and perilous threats that can result in demand destruction. Additionally, the course investigates the emerging micro startup approach that involves a small team of entrepreneurs who innovate a new offering and/or business model.

The course explores the intersection of leadership and entrepreneurship within established organizations–companies, non-profit organizations and public sector organizations. It is widely recognized that all established organizations must engage in entrepreneurial activities to one degree or another if they are to remain viable. Entrepreneurial efficacy, in large part, depends on effective leadership. But unlike conventional notions of leadership as a static leader-follower paradigm (military model), leadership in the entrepreneurial context requires entrepreneurial agents to dynamically alternate between leading and following as appropriate to the circumstances.

This course interrogates popular culture as a qualitative text. Qualitative research methods such as semiotics, textual analysis, and content analysis will be utilized to explore how identities like race, class, gender, and sexuality are represented and constructed in popular culture forms. Many forms of popular culture will be investigated with the intent to analyze, critique, and understand. Forms to be considered include television, film, music, digital media, as well as aspects of material culture such as dress, games, and toys. In addition to learning how to analyze popular culture through media textual analysis, the course will also examine the history of popular culture, its power, and complexities as well as how it is used as a tool of revealing, producing and reproducing ideology and political struggle.

Alternative Approaches to Literacy Instruction for Students with Disabilities.
Prerequisite: Admitted to Teacher Education.
This course focuses on the design, implementation, and evaluation of reading and writing instruction for students with mild to moderate high-incidence disabilities, including individuals from diverse cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. The teaching methodology emphasized in this course is explicit, systematic, and developmental. All strategies and approaches that are discussed in this course are supported by empirical research with students with reading and writing disabilities, as well as students at-risk for experiencing reading and writing difficulties in school. While there is empirical evidence that many of the approaches and strategies discussed in this course are successful with students with low incidence disabilities (e.g., autism, deaf and hard of hearing) and typically developing students without learning difficulties, students in this course will study methods for literacy instruction that are most appropriate for students with reading and writing disabilities. Specifically, students will study explicit instructional methods and strategies used to support the development of emergent literacy, phonological awareness, decoding, word reading, vocabulary, reading fluency, reading comprehension, written expression, and spelling skills. In addition, students will demonstrate their knowledge and usage of these methods and strategies by: (a) participating in class activities and assignments that support lectures and assigned readings, (b) evaluating the effectiveness of literacy curricula and technology tools for students with reading and writing disabilities, and (c) designing and implementing a sequence of lessons that target specific literacy skill areas while reflecting on one’s delivery of instruction.

This course will familiarize students with the basic
principles and uses of forensic science in the American
system of justice. Forensic science is the study and
application of science to the processes of law and involves
the collection, examination, evaluation and interpretation
of evidence. This field encompasses many scientific areas,
which, if used properly, can make invaluable contributions
to the resolution of social and legal disputes. The course
will review the basic applications of the biological,
physical, chemical, medical and behavioral sciences to
questions of evidence and law. In doing so, students should
gain a basic understanding of the capabilities and
limitations of the forensic sciences as they are presently
practiced.

Convention on the Status of Refugees, the implementation of that convention through the U.S. Refugee Act of 1980 and subsequent related legislation, political and judicial efforts to define the extent of the protections afforded under international and domestic law, current proposals to amend the laws, and the practice of asylum law in the United States.

The central goal of this course is to prepare you to represent an asylum seeker in the United States, while giving you a strong foundation in the laws that protect refugees and asylum-seekers.  To this end, the course aims to: (1) give you a substantive basis in the law and the tools you need to answer questions of law that arise in your future practice; (2) orient you in the relevant procedures and highlight the skills you will need in order to meaningfully engage with clients seeking asylum; and (3) introduce you to issues in law and policy that your generation of lawyers must struggle with, and hopefully resolve.

This class emphasizes learning by doing, so you should not only be prepared to participate actively in class discussion, but poised to engage in group exercises and the representation of a simulated client created for this class, which will occupy much of the second half of the course.

Recommended prior courses: Law 7200 (Environmental Law) and/or Law 7320 (Land Use Law) Beginning in the 1970's, the nation federalized environmental protection with a series of major pieces of legislation. Each of these laws focused on the clean up of a single environmental medium, mandating cleaner air, water, soils, etc. Increasingly, however, diverse interests from real estate financing companies to local government officials have called for an integrated approach that combines land use planning techniques and environmental law and regulation. Ecosystem Management Law will explore these laws, regulations, and techniques for environmental management. The course is thus recommended for those students who wish to position themselves for careers in real estate, land use, and environmental law.

Prerequisites:  Graduate student in the Byrdine F. Lewis School of Nursing and Health Professions or consent of instructor.
Assessment of body weight, body dimensions, and body composition is of considerable interest to those working in the health professions, as the information derived from these assessments is associated with health risks.  In addition, the health professional’s ability to accurately plot changes in body composition over time is important for determining whether the patient/client is changing in a way that reduces or increases health risk.  There are numerous strategies for assessing body dimensions and composition, ranging from weight/height growth charts used with children, to skinfolds, and to more sophisticated analysis techniques that involve bioelectrical impedance and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.  This course will review both the historical and new methods available to health professionals for the assessment of body dimensions and body composition, with special emphasis on the strengths and weaknesses of each technique and how these techniques may be appropriately used with the client/patient.

Business is largely about transactions – to sell goods or services to customers (including the government), to obtain goods and service from vendors and suppliers, to merge or divest the company, to enter into joint ventures, to form international agreements, etc. Transactions generate revenue for the firm. Transactions that turn out differently than expected can cost income.  This course examines many types of contracts and scenarios where contracts are essential to the business deal and explores how these contracts should be written to comply with legal requirements. Students will evaluate contracts for legal aspects, completeness as to business objective, contingencies and risk assessment, using law, enterprise risk management frameworks and quantitative methods and analysis.

This course focuses on why large portions of the American economy are subject to government regulation (rather than private regulation) in order to address risks posed to individuals, firms, and society and to acheieve particular public policy goals.  Private regulations relp on agreements or litigation among private parties to change the behavior of individuals and firms.  Congress and state legislatures create government agencies to address issues that they have concluded cannot or should not be addressed through private, regulations.  These government agencies create, implement, and enforce government regulations.

Prerequisite:  Graduate student in BFLSONHP or consent of instructor.
Assessment of body weight, body dimensions, and body composition is of considerable interest to those working in the health professions, as the information derived from these assessments is associated with health risks.  In addition, the health professional’s ability to accurately plot changes in body composition over time is important for determining whether the patient/client is changing in a way that reduces or increases health risk.  There are numerous strategies for assessing body dimensions and composition, ranging from weight/height growth charts used with children, to skinfolds, and to more sophisticated analysis techniques that involve bioelectrical impedance and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.  This course will review both the historical and new methods available to health professionals for the assessment of body dimensions and body composition, with special emphasis on the strengths and weaknesses of each technique and how these techniques may be appropriately used with the client/patient.

AIDS has had an incredible impact on the world. In a time when infectious diseases have supposedly been conquered, a new virus, one with incredible stigma and other negative connotations attached, comes along and baffles the biomedical community. Further it has profoundly affected societal systems as diverse as sexual practices and the FDA drug approval process. Over twenty five years after AIDS was first announced we still do not have a handle on this epidemic. This course explores the social dimensions of HIV/AIDS in the U.S. and globally. We examine the social forces that impact and determine the course and experience of the epidemic as we also explore the impact the epidemic has had on communities and cultures worldwide. The course surveys 1) the social construction of the disease and its controversies; 2) the cultural aspects of AIDS; 3) the impact upon and response from particularly affected communities and social groups; 4) economic causes and consequences of AIDS; and 5) the politics of governmental, non-governmental and grassroots responses to the disease.

Feminist Pedagogy. 
Introduction to both theoretical and practical components of feminist pedagogy. The phrase “feminist pedagogy” refers to pedagogical practices that work to be anti-oppressive and liberatory. It develops within a tradition of critical pedagogy, which involves both a critique of the university as a place that acts as a “gatekeeper” for class privilege and “appropriate” subject-formation as well as a vision of the university where we can contest power relations and imagine new possibilities for expanding the intelligible. In other words, feminist pedagogy imagines the classroom as a space to encourage deep exploration of social problems in order to critically evaluate and explore social justice frameworks. In the class, students will utilize these theoretical frameworks in order to develop their own specific goals and evaluate specific teaching strategies for use in their own classrooms.
